        <p className="lead">With measles cases on the rise globally, many adults are wondering whether they need a vaccine booster. We spoke with infectious disease experts to get answers to your most pressing questions.</p>

        <h2>Understanding Measles and Immunity</h2>
        <p>Measles is one of the most contagious viral diseases known to affect humans. The virus can remain airborne for up to two hours after an infected person leaves an area, and up to 90% of non-immune people who come in contact with the virus will become infected.</p>

        <h2>Who Needs a Booster?</h2>
        <p>According to the CDC, you may need a measles booster if you:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Were born after 1957 and have no documentation of vaccination</li>
          <li>Received only one dose of the MMR vaccine</li>
          <li>Are in a high-risk group (healthcare workers, international travelers)</li>
          <li>Live in an area experiencing a measles outbreak</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Expert Recommendations</h2>
        <p>Dr. Sarah Jenkins, infectious disease specialist at Mayo Clinic, recommends: "If you're unsure about your vaccination status, it's better to get a booster than risk infection. The MMR vaccine is safe, and there's no harm in receiving another dose even if you're already immune."</p>

        <h2>Testing for Immunity</h2>
        <p>A simple blood test can check for measles antibodies. This test can help determine if you need a booster shot. However, many experts recommend getting the booster without testing if you're unsure of your immunity status, as the vaccine is safe and often less expensive than antibody testing.</p>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>The recent increase in measles cases worldwide has raised concerns about waning immunity in adults. While most people vaccinated as children maintain lifelong immunity, certain groups may benefit from a booster shot. Consult with your healthcare provider to determine if you need additional protection against measles.</p>

        <p className="lead">New research suggests that a diet rich in fiber and fermented foods may help prevent and manage inflammatory diseases by promoting a healthy gut microbiome.</p>
        
        <h2>The Gut-Inflammation Connection</h2>
        <p>Recent studies have shown that the gut microbiome plays a crucial role in regulating inflammation throughout the body. A diverse and healthy gut microbiota can help maintain immune system balance and reduce chronic inflammation.</p>

        <h2>Key Findings from Recent Research</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>High-fiber diets promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria</li>
          <li>Fermented foods introduce beneficial probiotics to the gut</li>
          <li>Certain fiber types may help reduce inflammatory markers</li>
          <li>Combined approach shows most promising results</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Recommended Foods</h2>
        <p>To boost your intake of fiber and fermented foods, consider incorporating:</p>
        <h3>High-Fiber Foods:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Legumes (beans, lentils, chickpeas)</li>
          <li>Whole grains (oats, quinoa, brown rice)</li>
          <li>Vegetables (especially leafy greens)</li>
          <li>Fruits (berries, apples, pears)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Fermented Foods:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Yogurt and kefir</li>
          <li>Sauerkraut and kimchi</li>
          <li>Kombucha</li>
          <li>Miso and tempeh</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Implementation Strategies</h2>
        <p>Start slowly when increasing fiber intake to avoid digestive discomfort. Aim for 25-35 grams of fiber per day, and introduce fermented foods gradually. Stay well-hydrated to help fiber do its job effectively.</p>

        <h2>Expert Recommendations</h2>
        <p>According to Dr. Emily Chen, gastroenterologist: "The evidence supporting the benefits of a fiber-rich diet with fermented foods is compelling. This dietary approach not only supports gut health but may also help prevent various inflammatory conditions."</p>
